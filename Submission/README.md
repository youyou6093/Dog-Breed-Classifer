This is the readme file for my submission.

The dataset for this project are linked in the jupyter notebook and also the proposal. The used libraries are numpy, matplotlib, opencv, PIL, pytorch.

The notebook can run without any additional files once the required libraries are installed and the data are located in the required folders (put dog_images folder and lfw folder directly at the root location).

The submission also contains the project report and project proposal.
